🎀 Fashion Recommendation Website

A modern web application for discovering and browsing fashion products with smart filters, smooth UI, and a clean user experience. ✨


🌟 Overview

The Fashion Recommendation Website is a full-stack web application designed to help users browse fashion products effortlessly using:

Smart filters

Dynamic search

Gender-based switching

Originally, the project planned to use a public fashion API to fetch real products. However, due to API limitations and the unavailability of reliable free endpoints, the idea was redesigned into a self-curated recommendation platform.

This pivot demonstrates:
✅ Practical problem-solving
✅ Product thinking
✅ Real-world development adaptation
