🎀 Fashion Recommendation Website

A modern web application for discovering and browsing fashion products with smart filters, smooth UI, and a clean user experience.

🌟 Overview

The Fashion Recommendation Website is a full-stack web application designed to help users browse fashion products effortlessly using smart filters, dynamic search, and gender-based switching.
The project was originally planned to use a public fashion API to fetch real products, but due to API limitations and unavailability of reliable free endpoints, the idea was redesigned into a self-curated recommendation platform with complete control over UI, UX, performance, and dataset.
This pivot demonstrates practical problem-solving, product thinking, and real-world development adaptation.
